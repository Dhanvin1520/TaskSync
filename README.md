🗂️ TaskSync – Task Management Application

Hi! 👋 I’m Dhanvin Vadlamudi.
This project is a full-stack MERN Task Management app where users can register/login, create, update, delete, and filter tasks by category and status — all in a clean, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.I treated this as a real-world project to demonstrate my MERN skills with secure JWT authentication, smooth REST API integration, and mobile-first design.
